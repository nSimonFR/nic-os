"""Vector helpers for the CLIP profiles — pure maths, no I/O, no psycopg2.

Immich stores embeddings in `smart_search.embedding` as pgvector `vector(1024)`.
No vector adapter is registered on our connections, so psycopg2 hands them back
as the text literal `[0.1,-0.2,...]`; these functions are the parse/format pair
for that, plus the two operations a centroid needs.

Distances themselves are computed in SQL (`embedding <=> %s::vector`) so the
1024 floats stay in Postgres — see store.distance_to and backfill.
