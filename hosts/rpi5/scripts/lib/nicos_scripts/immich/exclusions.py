"""Remembering "I took that out of the album".

Everything here is append-only: the workflow files photos and never removes one.
That is deliberate — a bad threshold should be a cleanup job, not data loss. But
it means a photo you delete from an album by hand comes back the next time
`immich-clip-backfill --apply` runs, because that scan excludes only CURRENT
members and a removed match is a fresh candidate again.

So a removal is treated as a decision. Immich already records every one in
`album_asset_audit(albumId, assetId, deletedAt)` — but prunes it after 31 days
(`MAX_DAYS = 30` in sync.service.js), so it cannot be the memory itself. Each
pass copies anything new out of that window into our own table, which is never
pruned, and every filing path skips the pairs it holds.

Net effect: taking a photo out of the album in the Immich UI means "never file
this here again", learned from what you already do, with nothing extra to run.
