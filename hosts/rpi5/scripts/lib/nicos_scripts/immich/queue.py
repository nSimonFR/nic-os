"""The pending queue — verdicts that could not be reached yet.

A photo uploaded while beast is offline has no CLIP embedding, so the workflow
step cannot decide anything about it. The old behaviour was to wait 60s and then
answer "not food", which is a lie: the answer is *unknown*, and it was thrown
away. Given beast is usually offline, that lost most of the decisions.

So an undecidable asset is recorded here instead, and `drain` finishes the job
once Immich has embedded it. Same shape as Immich's own ML offload: the work
queues, waits for the GPU host, and completes when it returns.

SQLite rather than a JSON file because two processes write it — the sidecar on
every undecidable asset, the drainer when it resolves one. WAL mode so a drain
pass never blocks a live classify.
